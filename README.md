# LinuxFix
A collection of mini-scripts all written in Bash that run system admin tasks and help harden the computer.
The repository is broken up into modular-independent scripts each performing a specific task, and there is a main script that runs through all of them together.

Yoy may use them to help out with your own tasks. These scripts come as is and I am not promissing any updates.

## How to use
To run the entire script, download the LinuxFix folder, navigate into it, and simply run `sudo bash LinuxFix.sh` (LinuxFix.sh should be in your present working directory. if it is not, you're in the wrong directory)

Alternatively, you can run any of the `.sh ` scripts in `core-files` individually.
