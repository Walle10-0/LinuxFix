# LinuxFix
A collection of mini-scripts all written in Bash that run system admin tasks and help harden the computer.
The repository is broken up into modular-indipendent scripts each performing a specific task, and there is a main script that runs through all of them together.

These scripts come as is and I have no intention of making major updates.

You can start by downloading the main LinuxFix folder
